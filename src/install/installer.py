    """Managed skills whose files on disk are what a Hermes skill edit left there.

    Hermes may edit a skill in `skills.external_dirs` in place -- its
    background self-improvement review does so unprompted -- and records every
    such write in its curator ledger (`install.curator_ledger`). Upstream's
    rule for the skills it installs itself is that an edited skill counts as
    locally modified and updates stop overwriting it. OMH holds its managed
    skills to the same rule: a skill a Hermes write still accounts for is kept
    as it is and reported, rather than refusing the whole install the way an
    unexplained change does, or being stranded in the generation the edit
    happened in. `--force` keeps its meaning and replaces it, and the report
    says that it did.

    Rule: a skill counts as Hermes-edited only while the ledger accounts for
    what is on disk, file by file where the manifest can tell:
      - SKILL.md differs from its manifest record: kept only when the newest
        ledger write to that very SKILL.md left exactly the content it holds
        now. Otherwise the difference is a person's hand edit -- even beside a
        ledgered write to a supporting file -- and keeps its existing contract
        (refuse the install until `--force`).
      - SKILL.md matches its record: kept when a ledger write to any file of
        the skill (a supporting file, which the manifest never hashed) left
        what that file holds now, or removed a file OMH renders for the skill
        that is still absent. An absent file OMH never renders is not counted:
        a `write_file` undone by a `remove_file` leaves exactly OMH's render.
    Only a record at the directory an install renders for its name counts
    (`render_record_dir`): the manifest also records a person's copy of a
    managed skill elsewhere in the pack under the same name.
    A row counts only the files whose hash it changed, so a row that lists a
    whole skill (Hermes before 0.21.4 did) does not make OMH's own files read
    as edits, and a row whose result was since replaced, by `--force` or a
    rollback, is history: counting it would hold the skill back from every
    later update. That narrows "differs from the manifest and/or the ledger
    names it" on purpose, and its cost is stated: a Hermes edit made while
    the ledger is switched off (`skills.ledger: false`) still refuses like a
    hand edit.

    A skill kept once stays kept while its SKILL.md is unchanged since, through
    the evidence its manifest record carries. Read against the pack the
    manifest describes, which on a staged update is the previous generation.
    A skill whose SKILL.md is gone is not an edit; the install renders it
    again (`missing_managed_skills`).

    When `overwritten`, each entry also names, in `ledger_copy`, the files of
    the skill whose current content Hermes' ledger still holds a copy of, so
    the report can say whether the replaced edit is recoverable from there.
    That is judged against `stored_writes`, every write the ledgers record
    (`read_ledger_writes` `every_write`), read here when not given.

    A Hermes edit under the skill's own label in a directory this release
    does not render it into -- an earlier release's directory after a move,
    or a same-name copy elsewhere in the pack -- is reported as `left_behind`
    and nothing else: it is not kept (nothing is skipped for it), not carried,
    and not cleared. Unreported, it would vanish with the generation it sits in.

    category off the path. Installs are non-destructive, so each move wrote the
    new directories and left the old ones beside them: an observed machine went
    from 92 skills to 184 after the relabel, doubling the pack's index lines
    and context weight, and the manifest then reported every vanished old path as a
    local modification. A leftover flat copy after this move would double-register
    every skill in Hermes AND keep a "general" group in the banner, which is the
    exact symptom the categorized layout exists to remove.

    The safety rules match `_prune_orphaned_skills`: remove only a directory that
    is (a) named after a catalog skill under either spelling, (b) recorded in the

    that carries render marks, (d) means the record carries the mark and
    nothing in the directory changed since OMH rendered it, the same question
    the orphan pruner asks (`_render_mark_refusal`). An unmarked record is never
    removed, `--force` or not; a marked one that changed, or that cannot be
    judged because a ledger could not be read (``ledger_unreadable``), is left

    that loses. Everything left is returned in `skipped` with the reason.
    Under a manifest written before marks existed, (d) is the rule it was
    written under: byte-identical to what the manifest recorded, with anything
    a user edited kept and reported in `retained` unless ``force``.

    a manifest from before marks), and `kind` is `flat_copy` for a whole

    marks) and `kind` always `retired_skill`; every candidate left in place is returned
    second with the reason; third, what ``force`` lost for each changed directory it removed.
    ``writes`` are Hermes' ledger writes, for what "changed" means (`_render_mark_refusal`),
    ``stored_writes`` every write the ledgers record, for what a ``force`` removal loses,
    and ``ledger_unreadable`` says a ledger exists that could not be read, which leaves a
    marked directory with nothing else against it in place (`ledger_unreadable`) until
    ``force``; with ``remove`` false nothing is deleted and only the verdicts are returned.

    The rule is provenance. The manifest records every SKILL.md under the pack, not only
    what OMH rendered, so a record alone never made a directory OMH's to delete.

    - Under a manifest that carries render marks (`RENDER_MARKS_FLAG`): a directory is
      pruned only when its record (a) names a skill absent from the full catalog, (b)
      carries the render mark, and (c) nothing in it changed since OMH rendered it: its
      SKILL.md still has the hash OMH wrote, its record carries no kept Hermes-edit
      evidence, and the ledger records no write under it (`_render_mark_refusal`).
      Every other file in the directory goes with it. A record
      without the mark is a directory an install merely found (`not_rendered_by_omh`) and
      is never removed, ``force`` or not. A marked one whose SKILL.md changed
      (`changed_since_rendered`) is left on a plain install; ``force`` removes it, because
      the mark proves OMH rendered that path and ``force`` is the person's consent to lose
      local changes -- the same meaning it has for a live skill. Without that, a retired
      skill someone once touched would stay forever.
    - Under a manifest written before marks existed: the rule it was written under. (a),
      plus sha-unmodified vs. the manifest record unless ``force``; it does not know what
      OMH rendered and does not look for Hermes writes. This is what lets a retired skill
      be cleaned up once; the manifest this install writes carries marks.

    Whichever rule admitted the record, these still hold, as defence in depth: the
    directory sits where an OMH release renders skills (`omh_layout_dir`); it resolves
    strictly inside the skills directory; it is not a category directory or any directory
    holding other skills below it (a stray `guide/SKILL.md` must never take the category
    with it); and it is not, under another spelling, a directory this catalog renders a
