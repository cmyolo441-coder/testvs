"""An edit tool's inline diff, as rows under that tool's row in the transcript.

Hermes renders the diff itself before it reaches the wire
(`agent/display.py::render_edit_diff_with_delta`, Hermes 6c61c3e27d):
`_emit_inline_diff` writes a "  ┊ review diff" header meant for its own
terminal printer, then `_render_inline_unified_diff` writes, per file, an
`a/x → b/x` header (the `---`/`+++` pair folded into one line), `@@` hunk
headers, and `+` / `-` / context lines, each wrapped in 24-bit SGR colour;
`_summarize_rendered_diff_sections` caps a long diff and appends one summary
line ("… omitted N diff line(s) …"). `tool.complete.payload.inline_diff` is
those lines joined by "\\n".

So the colour is stripped (`clean_text`, which drops whole escape sequences),
the review header is dropped as Ink drops it, every other line is classified
by its first characters, and the theme paints it: added and removed lines as
bands from the gutter's edge to the right edge, the file header in the label
style, context like code, anything else dim. Diff lines hard-wrap like fenced
code, never splitting a glyph; the summary and other prose word-wrap.

Hunk headers are not rows. Their `-a +c` starts number the lines after them
in a dim, right-aligned gutter (the new file's number for added and context
lines, the old file's for removed ones), and a hunk after the first leaves a
`⋮` in the gutter where the numbering jumps. The gutter is `DIFF_INDENT`
cells, wider only for a number that needs it, so a band starts where the
indent ends; a terminal too narrow for it gets neither gutter nor indent.
