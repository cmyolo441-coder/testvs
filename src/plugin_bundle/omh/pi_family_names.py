"""Spellings the pi-family runtime's external tools use, built in one place.

OMH does not choose these names: a host binary on PATH, its state
directories and environment variables, and the runtime's own config files.
They are assembled here from pieces, once, so the repo's text never names the
upstream products and every other module imports the name instead of
repeating it. It imports nothing from `omh`: it sits in the plugin bundle,
which Hermes loads without the `omh` package on its path.
