"""Which live Hermes TUI session a HUD read is for, from the host's own records.

The host names one TUI session two ways and only one of them reaches a widget.
``state.db`` rows, and the plan-todo records keyed to match them, use the
durable session key (``20260917_132533_8da9b8``). The per-TUI active-session
file a widget reads holds the gateway TRANSPORT id (``ebe3eaaa``, uuid4
hex[:8]) whenever its session was created rather than resumed. Both questions
are answered here, from a different host surface each, because a widget cannot
know which vocabulary its own reference is in.

``state.db`` is the host's own record of which sessions exist and which one
the user is in front of. Two HUD readers need the same answer from it:

* the effective-yolo projection (``approval_bypass``), which may only read a
  ``/yolo`` flag off a session a widget is actually rendering, and
* the plan-todo session scope (``runtime_reader._todo_summary``), which must
  not project a previous session's checklist into a new one.

Both scope the question identically -- ``source='tui'``, not ended, archived,
or hidden, not a delegation child, ordered by the host's own MRU column
(``last_activity_at``) -- so the scoping lives here once instead of as two
copies of the same SQL.

An empty result means the question is UNANSWERABLE here: no ``state.db``, an
older schema, an unreadable file, or no live TUI session at all. It is never a
negative answer, and every caller must fall back to what it would have done
without this surface rather than acting on the silence.

    at", and every filter in it exists for that question. This answers a
    different one -- "does the host say THIS session is still running" -- and
    so shares none of them.

    The distinction is not academic. Routes are written from whatever surface
    the agent runs on: measured on the owner's two homes, the miku profile's
    routes come from ``slack`` (132) and ``subagent`` (33) sessions and none
    from a TUI, and the default home already has ``desktop`` ones beside its
    TUI ones. Asking the TUI list whether a slack writer is live answers
    "it is not in this list", which is not the same statement, and reading it
    as "not live" restored a baseline out from under a session mid-dispatch
    (#1737 review).

    So: no ``source`` filter, because a route's writer is usually not a TUI.
    No ``_delegate_from`` filter, because a delegated child writes routes too
    and its liveness is a real question. No ``archived``/``hidden`` filter,
    because those say where a session is displayed, not whether it is over.

    ``$HERMES_HOME/runtime/active_sessions.json`` is the host's own lease
    registry of currently open chat surfaces, and the only place on disk where
    the two names for one session meet: each entry carries the durable key as
    ``session_id`` and the transport id as ``metadata.live_session_id``. The
    host mints both on one line of ``session.create`` and hands them to the
    registry together, so the pairing is the host's own statement of identity,
    not a correlation inferred here. The transport id is in no ``state.db``
    column, which is why the widget's reference resolves to nothing without
    this read.

    Only ``surface: 'tui'`` entries answer, matching the scope of
    ``live_tui_session_rows`` -- a gateway surface's lease says nothing about
    which TUI is rendering.

    An empty answer means the question is UNANSWERABLE here: no registry, an
    unreadable or unexpected one, or no lease naming this transport id. It is
    never a statement that the reference is invalid, and a caller must fall
    back to treating the reference as its own identity.

    The host claims a session's lease on its FIRST REAL TURN rather than at
    creation, deliberately, so that abandoned drafts hold no slot. A TUI
    nobody has prompted in therefore has no entry at all -- and owns no plan
    either, so the empty answer and the empty panel agree.
