"""The way back from a prepared delegation route.

`delegation_routing.write_delegation_route` is the one-way half: it sets the
three routable keys Hermes re-reads per dispatch. Nothing put back what was
there before, so a route chosen for one lane stayed in `config.yaml` as every
later session's delegation default (#1724).

This module owns the way back. It records, beside the route write and under
the same lock:

* the **baseline** -- what the three keys held before OMH first wrote them. A
  key the file did not carry is recorded by being ABSENT from the mapping, so
  restoring it removes the key rather than writing an empty string.
* the **last write** -- the exact three-key mapping OMH left in the file, plus
  the session and task that left it there.
* the **config path** those statements are about.

## The baseline is what the PERSON had, not what OMH left

Reading "whatever the file holds" as the person's value is wrong on exactly
the machine this issue came from, where the file already held a leaked OMH
route: the first new route would have recorded `claude-fable-5-1` as the
baseline and every later restore would have put the most expensive model in
the chain back, permanently.

The evidence to recognise that lives in the same OMH home. Every route OMH
writes appends to `route-provenance.json`, so before capturing a baseline
this compares the current three keys with the newest record there that left a
route in the file. On an exact match of all three the value is OMH's own
leftover, the baseline is recorded as "keys absent", and `baseline_origin`
says `omh_leftover` so a reader is never told a guess was an observation. The
same check runs on a re-capture, which closes the hole a failed record write
would otherwise reopen: the route lands, nothing is recorded, and the next
route would have enshrined it.

## Scope: a task, because `on_session_end` is per turn

`on_session_end` is not a session boundary. Hermes fires it from
`agent/turn_finalizer.py`, whose own comment reads "run_conversation() runs
once per message", and `docs/SESSION-ACTIVITY-RECEIPTS.md` already recorded
that. A route therefore comes back at the end of the turn that wrote it, and
that is the design rather than an accident: "route the NEXT dispatch" is a
turn-local intent, a `delegate_task` is dispatched inside the turn that set
the route, and a child already running keeps its model.

The scope is the TASK, not the turn, because a plugin tool cannot learn the
turn. The host threads `turn_id` to hooks and to `handle_function_call`, but
`model_tools._execute_tool` passes a registry handler only `task_id` and
`session_id`; the turn id exists elsewhere solely in a private ContextVar of
`tools.approval_context` with no getter.

What a task is differs by flow, and both are ordinary:

* **TUI and CLI.** `_bind_turn_identity` defaults `task_id` to a fresh uuid
  per turn, so task scope IS turn scope. A restore that does not happen at
  its own turn end -- see below -- is then never retried by a later turn of
  this session, and waits for the next session start.
* **Every gateway platform** (Slack, Discord, Telegram, Feishu, the API
  server). `gateway/run_turn_runner.py` passes `task_id: ctx.session_id` and
  `gateway/run_turn.py` states that task_id is session-scoped, so the task
  id is constant for the session and the scope is effectively the session.
  A route survives later turns of that session, and a missed restore is
  retried by the next turn end. This is the majority flow on the machine
  #1724 came from, where routes come from `slack` and `subagent` sessions.

A route does not always end with its turn, and two paths are known:

* A `lock_unavailable` at turn end (the budget is 0.1s) leaves the route.
  In the gateway flow the next turn end retries it; in the TUI/CLI flow
  nothing does before the next session start. The party that could not take
  the lock is also the party that cannot record that a restore is owed, so
  there is no cheap durable marker to retry from -- `pre_llm_call` at the
  start of a later turn is where such a retry would go, and it is not built
  here.
* A session killed mid-task, which is what `on_session_start` covers.

In both, the route survives until the next session start. A session start
puts it back once nothing says the writer's conversation is still running:
the writer's row is closed (or, after a compaction, every row Hermes
continued it in is), or that row's activity stamp is more than six hours old
(or unusable) and so is the route. A route whose writer row cannot be found,
or whose compaction continuation cannot be read, is held until the route
itself is six hours old. Only a conversation whose row shows activity within
the last six hours, and whose continuation can be read, holds it past that.
Turn scope makes a leak short and bounded rather than impossible.

`action=fallback` is the one flow that legitimately spans turns: a child that
dies on HTTP 400 is reported in a later turn. It used to read the chain
position out of the live `delegation.*` values, which a turn-end restore
empties, so it now recovers that position from the newest provenance record
the calling conversation wrote. See `delegate_route_tool`.

## A route is one conversation's; the keys are only where Hermes reads it

The three keys are one per profile and every session on it reads them, so a
route written by one conversation was the route of whichever session
dispatched next. Two sessions routing close together lost the earlier one's
route between its `set` and its `delegate_task`, and the child ran on the
other session's model with nothing reported (#2251). A released Hermes gives
a plugin no other way to name a child's model: the model-facing
`delegate_task` takes no model or provider, and its handler resolves the
child from `delegation.*` alone.

So each route is also recorded as the route of the conversation that set it,
in `conversation-routes.json`, under the same lock as the keys. `pre_tool_call`
for `delegate_task` then puts the DISPATCHING conversation's intent into the
keys just before Hermes reads them (`prepare_dispatch_route`): its own route
when it set one in this task; for a delegate child, the route of the
conversation it was delegated from (`_delegate_ancestors`); otherwise the
baseline in place of another conversation's route. Whatever another session
set, cleared, fell back to or restored in between, the dispatch runs on its
own route. A dispatch that cannot be made to run on its own route is
refused, never sent on another's. When the dispatching session's own
`state.db` row cannot be read, its lineage is unknown and another
conversation's route is left in the keys, as every dispatch did before.

Two more files keep an entry that failed to change from being applied, and
each is written before the `conversation-routes.json` write it covers, so it
survives that write failing. `conversation-take-outs.json` names the entries
a `clear` or chain exhaustion released (`_stamp_take_out`).
`conversation-writes.json` holds each writer's newest `set`, keyed like the
entries and in their shape (`_stamp_conversation_write`). An entry older
than its own key's stamp is the route that write failed to replace, so the
stamp stands in for it, and the writer's own dispatch -- or a child that
inherits from it -- runs on the newest route (`_in_force`). An older entry of
the same writer under another key that names another route is superseded,
not its intent (`_not_superseded`). A stamp stands in only for an entry that
survived the take-out filter, and every release -- turn end, session start,
`clear`, chain exhaustion -- marks the writer's stamps released before it
deletes the entries, so neither a release nor a release whose own write
failed brings a route back through a stamp. A child inherits the newest
write of the conversations it descends from, stamps included; each
conversation counts only a route no older than its own newest stamp or
take-out, so a later write in one ancestor never hides another's route
(`_newest_inherited`). The profile-wide
`route-restore.json` cannot hold any of this, because the next writer's `set`
replaces it and a restore deletes it.

What this does not close, stated at its real size: the hook releases the lock
before Hermes reads the keys, so another session's dispatch or `set` landing
between the two -- the hook-to-handler gap, not the model's round trip that
the race used to span -- still wins. A call that another gate sends to a
person (`approve`) has its route written before the person answers, so the
wait for that answer is part of the gap. Only a per-call route from Hermes
removes it. And with `HERMES_IGNORE_USER_CONFIG=1` Hermes reads none of the
file OMH writes, so no route applies at all.

## Ownership, liveness, locking

Every restore is gated on the recorded write. The file's current three keys
are compared with what OMH recorded writing; equal means OMH still owns the
value, different means a person (or another tool) changed it and OMH leaves
it alone and drops its now-meaningless record. The decision reads recorded
values, never wording.

`on_session_start` covers the case a killed session never reaches: it
restores only a route whose recorded writer is not live, asked of that
writer's OWN `state.db` row. Each verdict is named so a caller can tell an
observation from an age bound; see `writer_session_liveness`. A row Hermes
closed to compact the conversation is not that conversation ending: rotating
compaction closes the writer's row mid-turn and goes on in a new one, so the
question is asked of the rows Hermes went on in, and a route whose
continuation cannot be read stays where it is.

The whole read-through-replace sits inside one lock, because two sessions
routing at once would otherwise both read "no baseline recorded" and the
second would record the first's route as the person's. The lock is
`awareness_delivery`'s, the plugin's single file-locking implementation
(`approval_bypass` already shares it), with a POSIX and a Windows backend. It
is held on the record file in the OMH home rather than on `config.yaml`,
because the mutual exclusion needed is between OMH writers and because OMH
creates no lock file inside the Hermes home. (It does write there: the route
writer creates and chmods a temp file next to `config.yaml` for its atomic
replace. The lock file is the thing that stays out.)

Contention is an error, not a silent retry: a writer that cannot take the
lock returns `lock_unavailable` and never reports `routed`. A platform with
neither lock backend is different and is reported through `lock_enforced`,
because refusing there would disable routing entirely.

## What a restore does NOT promise

It restores the three keys to their previous VALUES, not to their previous
bytes. The writer normalises quoting, emits the keys in `ROUTABLE_KEYS`
order, and drops an inline comment that sat on one of those three lines.
Every other byte of the file is untouched. Preserving the original lines
verbatim would mean carrying them through a writer shared with the route
path, which is more machinery than the difference is worth; the claim is
stated at its real strength here, in the changelog, and in the docs.

    `write_route_with_baseline` serializes on the restore record because the
    route write and its bookkeeping have to be one act. A `config.yaml`
    write from `omh setup`, `omh memory`, self-update or `system/targets`
    can land in the middle of that, so it takes the same
    lock rather than a second one of its own (#1742).

    The default wait is longer than the telemetry budget the lock ships
    with: a person is waiting on a CLI command, and dropping their write is
    worse than making them wait. A timeout raises `TimeoutError`, which the
    caller reports as a refusal.

    The asymmetry that makes this safe, written down because nothing else
    records it. `write_route_with_baseline` waits only the lock's own 0.1 s
    budget and returns an error rather than blocking a dispatch, so a CLI
    command holding this lock for longer than that DROPS a concurrent route
    write. The margin is the only reason that direction is safe, and it is
    not fixed: the hold grows with the size of the config, because every
    writer under it scans the whole file several times.

    Measured, mean of four runs each, against the 100 ms budget:

    | command        | 163-line config | 800-line synthetic |
    | -------------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
    | `omh apply`    | 2.0 ms          | 7.6 ms             |
    | `omh uninstall`| 3.4 ms          | 43.0 ms            |

    `omh uninstall` is the worst case, not `omh apply`: in the full scope it
    runs the registration removal and then the seven-key reversal. On a
    real config the headroom is ~30x; on a config four times that size it
    is closer to 2x. So two things break this: holding the lock across
    anything slow -- a network call, an interactive prompt, a subprocess --
    and adding another whole-file pass to a command that already holds it.
    Either should release the lock first.

    `require_writer_task` restricts the restore to the task that wrote the
    route, and `require_writer_session` to the session. The turn-end hook
    passes both, but a RECORDED task wins on its own: see
    `_writer_matches`.  `require_writer_not_live` is the session-start
    path's extra gate.

    `unrecorded_clear` is the escape hatch for a route with no record, and
    it has two strengths because its two callers differ. `"always"` is the
    explicit `clear` action: a person asked for the keys to come off and OMH
    cannot know what preceded them, so removing is both what clearing did
    before baselines existed and the only way to get an unrecorded route off
    a machine. `"if_omh_wrote"` is chain exhaustion, which is automatic and
    so may only remove a value OMH can prove it wrote; without that proof it
    reports `unrecorded_value_not_ours` and changes nothing, because the
    alternative was deleting the person's pinned model at the exact moment a
    lane had failed. Both run inside this lock, with the caller's
    `expected_previous`, because doing either outside left a window in which
    a concurrent route recorded a person's pinned model as a baseline that
    the next restore then discarded as a foreign edit.

    Every outcome is a `status` a caller can report: `restored`, `cleared` (a
    baseline with no keys to put back), `no_baseline_recorded`,
    `unrecorded_value_not_ours`, `foreign_edit`, `foreign_config`,
    `not_last_writer`, `writer_live`, `lock_unavailable`, or `error`.

    `release_writer` is the turn end's: the session whose own conversation
    routes end with this task. `clear` and chain exhaustion pass
    `release_conversation` and `release_task` instead: the caller's whole
    conversation, which says it wants no route any more. Either way the
    caller's routes are dropped inside the same lock as the restore, and only
    after it, so the two cannot come apart: a release that timed out after a
    restore succeeded left the route recorded, and the next dispatch of the
    same task put it back (#2251 review); a release BEFORE a restore that
    was then refused dropped the record of a route still in the keys. A
    restore that ends in `error` releases nothing. Other sessions' routes are
    never released by these callers.
    An automatic restore (turn end, session start) that takes a record out
    also drops that writer's conversation routes, so a route whose keys are
    gone cannot come back at a later dispatch.

    The question is asked of the WRITER'S OWN row, never of a list the writer
    may not belong to. Asking the live-TUI list instead was the first version
    of this and it was wrong: that list is scoped to "which session is a
    person looking at", so a writer on any other surface is absent from it by
    construction, and absence read as `not_live` restored a baseline under a
    live writer whenever some unrelated TUI happened to be open. Measured on
    the owner's homes, that is the common case rather than the edge: the
    profile that routes most writes every route from a `slack` or `subagent`
    session (#1737 review).

    No transport-id reconciliation happens here. The only caller records the
    writer from `host_session_id(kwargs)`, which the host sets from
    `agent.session_id` -- already the durable key `state.db` rows carry -- so
    a reconciliation step would be unreachable code presenting itself as a
    necessary one.

    The verdicts, and which of them are observations:

    * `live` -- the row exists, the host has not closed it, and its activity
      stamp is inside the freshness window. An observation.
    * `not_live` -- the row exists and carries an `ended_at`. An observation,
      and the only one that clears a restore.
    * `unclosed_and_stale_by_age` / `unclosed_within_age_bound` -- the row
      exists, the host never closed it, and its activity is stale or
      unusable. This is a killed session, or a gateway session of a kind that
      never ends (55 of 57 slack sessions on the owner's machine are open
      rows). Nothing here observes that the process is gone, so the ROUTE's
      own age decides and the name says a bound answered.
    * `not_live_by_age` / `unknown_within_age_bound` -- no row at all, or the
      host surface could not be read. Same bound, same honesty about which
      question went unanswered.
    * `continuation_unverified` / `continuation_unverified_expired` --
      Hermes closed the writer's row to compact the conversation
      (`end_reason` `compression`), and the rows it went on in could not be
      read or authenticated. A closure for compaction is not the writer
      stopping and nothing read here says the conversation stopped, so the
      route is held -- until the route is older than the bound, as for a
      writer row that cannot be found, and then the age bound answers.

    A row Hermes closed for compaction is never answered from its own
    `ended_at`. Its verdict is the one the conversation's continuation gives
    (`compaction_continuations`): `live` while any continuation is running,
    `not_live` once Hermes closed every one, and the age bound for an
    unclosed one, as for any other row.

    The bound is `LIVE_TUI_SESSION_FRESH_SECONDS`, six hours. Task scope
    makes it matter far less than it did: the ordinary way back is the end of
    the writing task, and this path only covers a session killed mid-task.
    Nothing available shortens it -- the host's lease registry records which
    surfaces are open, not whether their processes are alive.
