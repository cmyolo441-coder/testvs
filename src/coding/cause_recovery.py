"""Match the recovery to the cause of one unit's failure.

`dispatch_failure_recovery` answers "what kind of failure was that" and offers
three ways out. It does not answer the question the 2026-09-11 incident turned
into a post-mortem item: *which* way out this particular cause admits. A
credential rejection and a permission denial both reach the operator as a
failed unit, and re-running is the right move for neither. A worker that has
been alive for thirty-six minutes retrying the same git workaround is not
failed at all, and adding a second worker to its scope is the worst available
move.

This module is that missing answer, and it is a table rather than a chain of
conditionals so that the answer for a cause can be read in one row.

Five rules are encoded here and nowhere else:

1. **A live worker wins over every other row.** If an in-flight marker still
   names this unit id or this worktree, the plan is `wait_for_live_worker` and
   no rerun is allowed, whatever the cause was. This is the "never add a second
   worker to a scope whose worker is still alive" rule; it is checked first
   precisely so no cause can talk its way past it. Marker presence is not
   liveness (`inflight` says so itself), so the plan reports the marker and
   asks for it to be cleared — it never claims the process exists.
2. **Re-running under the same permissions is not a recovery.** A permission or
   sandbox denial requires a fresh workspace preflight to pass before anything
   is re-dispatched.
3. **A limit is an account fact, not a clock fact.** A limit-shaped failure may
   be re-run only when the account differs from the one that hit the limit, or
   when the recorded reset has elapsed. `reset_text` is carried as the literal
   string the provider wrote and is never parsed into a time — the elapsed
   answer comes from the cooldown window going stale or from an explicitly
   observed `reset_elapsed`, both of which OMH can actually measure.
4. **Missing objects are supplemented, then ONE unit resumes.** The 36-minute
   stall was a partial clone described as complete. Rebuilding the fanout would
   destroy the work the failure left behind; the plan names the single unit.
5. **A stall re-runs only under changed conditions.** `conditions_fingerprint`
   folds the five things that decide whether an attempt is the same attempt
   (owner, model, prompt digest, worktree, permissions). Identical fingerprint,
   no rerun — that is "never re-run under identical failure conditions" made
   false-able rather than asserted in prose.

The table is deliberately keyed by BOTH vocabularies: the `failure_kind` enum
in `dispatch_failure_recovery` (what the dispatcher observed of the process and
its output) and the `unit_state` vocabulary in `unit_execution_state` (what was
observed of the work). A unit carries whichever its producer recorded, and a
unit that carries neither resolves to `unknown`, which offers nothing and
forbids nothing. `tests/test_cause_recovery.py` re-derives both vocabularies
from source and fails when one gains a member with no row, so the class is
caught without the table freezing either vocabulary.

The remaining `failure_kind` spellings are written as literals rather than
imported: the closed enum lives with the classifier that produces it, and this
module is imported BY that classifier, so only the one name the routing has to
branch on (`FAILURE_KIND_WORKSPACE_BLOCKED`) is worth the import that forced
the classifier's own import of this module to be deferred. The derived gate is
what keeps every other spelling equal.

Nothing here reads state, writes state, or spawns anything. `recovery_plan` is
a pure function of the unit record, the in-flight markers it is handed, and the
previous attempt's conditions.
