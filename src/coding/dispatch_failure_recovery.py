"""Classify a failed dispatch, say how to repair it, and offer the operator a choice.

A spawned agent CLI that dies because the provider quota is spent or the stored
credential is invalid used to reach the operator as `status: failed` plus a
bounded output tail. Both are recoverable and neither is recoverable the same
way: a limit clears on its own and a credential does not, so the two need
different words, different repair steps, and — because switching a coding owner
behind the operator's back is exactly what `AGENTS.md` forbids — an explicit
choice rather than an automatic fallback.

Three pieces live here.

1. **`failure_kind`**, a closed enum every failed unit envelope carries. The two
   synthetic exit codes the dispatcher assigns itself (127 for a binary missing
   from PATH, 124 for a unit that burned its timeout) classify first, because
   they are the dispatcher's own observation of the process rather than text the
   provider wrote. Then `auth_shaped`, then `limit_shaped`, then `crash` as the
   fallback.

   Auth is checked before limit deliberately, and the two pattern sets are not
   disjoint in practice: a 401 body routinely also mentions a rate limit for
   unauthenticated callers. An invalid credential is a state the operator must
   repair before ANY attempt can succeed; a limit is a state that clears on its
   own. Classifying an overlapping failure as `limit_shaped` would file it into
   the wait-it-out lane, where waiting can never clear it. Classifying it as
   `auth_shaped` costs the operator one re-auth check that the limit lane would
   have skipped, which is the cheaper of the two mistakes.

2. **Observed auth-failure signals**, persisted per owner beside the limit
   signals and cleared by the same rule (the next exit-0 for that owner). These
   are deliberately NOT the presence markers in `executor_auth_signals`: a marker
   is absent for every legitimate API-key install and never vetoes anything. A
   signal here is an observed runtime failure of a real spawn, which is why it
   is allowed to become a spawn cooldown while a marker never is.

3. **The recovery choice.** Three named actions — retarget to another owner,
   re-run through the Hermes subagent lane, or wait and retry later — and the
   `--on-failure` degradation for every non-interactive caller. Nothing here
   picks one on the operator's behalf; the default mode prints the card and the
   options and changes nothing.

4. **The cause-specific plan**, computed in `cause_recovery` and attached here.
   The three actions above answer "where else could this run"; the plan answers
   "may it run again at all, and what has to be true first". They are different
   questions and the plan is allowed to close an option: a unit whose objects
   are missing, whose permissions are denied, or whose worker is still alive
   would hand any new worker the same condition, so retarget and the Hermes
   lane are listed unavailable with the requirement named, instead of spending
   a second worker to reproduce the first one's failure. A quota and a stall
   are not inherited that way, so both lanes stay open for them.

Nothing in this module spawns anything. It classifies, it persists metadata, and
it renders choices. Acting on a choice is the dispatcher's job.
