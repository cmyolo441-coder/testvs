"""The pi-family runtime's external spellings, for the control plane.

The definitions live in `omh.plugin_bundle.omh.pi_family_names`, because the
plugin bundle needs them too and cannot import `omh` (see #1623). This module
re-exports them so control-plane code has one interop import path. Add a new
spelling there, never as a literal in a caller.
